    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:
    #
    #   py_modules=["my_module"],
    #
    package_dir={'': 'src'},
    packages=['chikyu_sdk', 'chikyu_sdk.config', 'chikyu_sdk.error', 'chikyu_sdk.resource'],  # Required

    # This field lists other packages that your project depends on to run.
    # Any package you put here will be installed by pip when your project is
    # installed, so they must be valid existing projects.
    #
    # For an analysis of "install_requires" vs pip's requirements files see:
    # https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/requirements.html
    install_requires=['requests', 'requests-aws4auth', 'boto3'],  # Optional

    # List additional groups of dependencies here (e.g. development
    # dependencies). Users will be able to install these using the "extras"
    # syntax, for example:
    #
    #   $ pip install sampleproject[dev]
    #
    # Similar to `install_requires` above, these must be valid existing
    # projects.
    extras_require={  # Optional
    },

    # If there are data files included in your packages that need to be
    # installed, specify them here.
    #
    # If using Python 2.6 or earlier, then these have to be included in
    # MANIFEST.in as well.
    package_data={  # Optional
    },

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may
    # need to place data files outside of your packages. See:
    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files
    #
    # In this case, 'data_file' will be installed into '<sys.prefix>/my_data'
    data_files=[],  # Optional

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the
    # "scripts" keyword. Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow
    # `pip` to create the appropriate form of executable for the target
    # platform.
    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
    entry_points={  # Optional
        'console_scripts': [],
